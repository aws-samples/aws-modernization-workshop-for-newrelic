# Observability with New Relic One

We are in the midst of the "Age of the Customer". Customers are expecting more: More services, more data, faster and more innovative solutions. Organizations and Industries must be agile and keep pace with customer expectations or risk becoming irrelevant. These expectations are pushing organizations into rapid transformational changes. These changes lead to complexity: More changes, more data, more dev teams, and just an overall faster rate of change.

Observability is required to ensure that changes do not affect users interactions and to measure success and/or a degradation affecting customers. Observability is the practice of instrumenting systems with tools to gather actionable data that provides not only the *when* of an error or issue, but more importantly the *why*. The latter is what teams need to respond quickly and resolve emergencies in modern software.

Observability helps modern software teams:

* Deliver high-quality software at scale
* Build a sustainable culture of innovation
* Optimize investments in cloud and modern tools
* See the real-time performance of their digital business 

This workshop provides an introduction to the core concept of Observability, walks you through instrumenting an application with New Relic APM, and details how to visualize your application's telemetry data using New Relic One Dashboards.
