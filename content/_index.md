# Welcome!

The purpose of these labs is to help you get the most out of your usage of New Relic One. The activities cover typical activities encountered by New Relic users.

The labs are written for use exclusively with AWS. Other than that, there are no firm prerequisites, but general Linux and AWS knowledge is assumed.

If you are taking these labs as part of a joint New Relic and AWS Workshop or Immersion Day, you may be asked to complete an assessment form upon completion.  If you have not been asked by New Relic to complete an assessment, you can safely ignore any comments in this workshop referencing it as it is not a requirement. 

# FAQ
