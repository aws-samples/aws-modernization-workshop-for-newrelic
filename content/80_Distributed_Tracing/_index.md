# Digging Deeper

While Transaction tracing is often effective in and of itself for analyzing activity in your application, it doesn't always catch every type of issue your user's can encounter and/or reveal all context needed for root cause analysis.  Sometimes you need to dig deeper.

Using New Relic Logs, you can see your logs in context of application execution and quickly determine the root cause of issues your customers are facing.
