### Well Done

Congratulations!  You have completed the New Relic Serverless Workshop!

### Final Thoughts
Since its launch in 2014, AWS Lambda has grown to serve hundreds of thousands of customers generating trillions of function invocations a month. The benefits are clear: AWS Lambda is an event-based serverless computing platform, with built-in autoscaling and infrastructure management, on which engineers can build and modify single-purpose functions without worrying about the underlying compute resources.

New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda is a set of features that let you monitor, visualize, troubleshoot, and alert on your functions. You get key data about each individual function; for example, New Relic uncovers aggregate performance data like throughput and error rates, and combines it with individual invocation data, including the invocation source, request component timing (external service requests, etc.), errors, and other data critical for troubleshooting. In other words, you’ll get the views you need to monitor overall activity; and you’ll be able to use that information to investigate specific requests when errors surface, all without the burden of managing disparate monitoring tools.

We hope that the workshop you completed has given you a better understanding of AWS Lambda, why Observability is important, and how New Relic Serverless for AWS Lambda can meet your organization's serverless monitoring needs.
