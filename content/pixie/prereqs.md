To get ready to use Pixie to debug an application on a Kubernetes cluster, we will deploy a demo microservices app named **TinyHat.me**, a simple API that provides virtual hats.

### S3 Bucket
Click [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home) to access the S3 console.

#### Creating the bucket
Click `Create bucket`.

1. Name your bucket in the `Bucket name` field. (Example: `tinyhat`)
2. Edit the Public Access settings to match the configuration below:

3. Leave all other settings as deafult and click `Create bucket`.

#### Allowing public access
On the S3 console, click on the newly created S3 bucket by identifying it with the name you assigned it to. (Example: `tinyhat`)

1. Click on `Permissions` and scroll down to `Bucket policy`.
2. Click `Edit` and paste the below policy in the editor, **remembering to replace `tinyhat` with your actual bucket name, if it differs**
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AddPerm",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::tinyhat/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
3. Click `Save changes`. If you configured your bucket correctly, you should see the labels `Publicly accessible` and Access labeled as `Public`.

### Getting Secrets
Head over to [the `My Security Credentials` page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials)

Click `Create Access Key` and save your access key ID and secret if you don't already don't have access.

Finally, modify these commands and enter them in your terminal to set the environment variables for secrets. Use the same terminal window to proceed to the next step.
``` 
export S3_ID=[AWS KEY ID]
export S3_SECRET=[AWS SECRET KEY]
```

### Working with EKS

Lets download and deploy the Tiny Hats Application. 

First run the bash command to download the kubefiles 
```bash
wget -q -O tmp.zip https://tinyhatkubefiles.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tinyhats.zip && unzip tmp.zip && rm tmp.zip
```

To apply the exported environment variables, run

```bash 
cd ~/environment/tinyhats/0-setup
for f in *.yaml; do envsubst < $f | kubectl apply -f -; done
```

Then, run
```bash 
kubectl get pods --watch
```  
to see when everything is finished spinning up.

{{% notice warning %}}
You may notice the fetch service on a Crash Loop. This is completely normal because it takes MySQL a few minutes to spin up.

### You're done! ðŸŽ‰
`tinyhats` should now be up and running! All your pods are ready to roll once you see this output from the command `kubectl get pods`:

```
tinyhats:~/environment/tinyhats $ kubectl get pods --watch

upload-service-7f57868797-4cmr4         1/1     Running   0          66s
``` 

Finally, run

```bash
kubectl get services
```

![gateway](/images/pixie/0-kubectl.png)

Export the URLs associated with the `Gateway-Service` by running. Make sure to replace `<YOUR_DATA_GOES_HERE>` with your Gateway Service `EXTERNAL-IP` from above.

```bash
export GATEWAYSERVICE = <YOUR_DATA_GOES_HERE>
```

Try pasting the URL for `Frontend-Service` in the browser. You should be greeted with the wonderful face of Bob Ross. Keep this URL handy as you will need it later in the workshop.
